ubcopenrobotics.ca website
===============

This website is written in PHP. This allows a modular approach at writting the website, reusing as much code as possible.
All pages make calls to some similar functions for including header, navigation bar, footnote, and footer code.
This allows changes to common assets to be made very easily.

The website itself makes use of Twitter Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com), which cuts down on the amount of CSS and JavaScript
we would otherwise have to write.
